             *  A doubly linked list is a linear data structure that has
             *  nodes connected to each other by two pointers, previous 
             *  and next pointers.
             *                     ->  ->   ->   ->   ->

             *  Doubly Linked List Methods:
             *  - Add(object data): Adds a node to the tail of the list.
             *  - Remove(object data): Deletes a specific node from the list.
             *  - Get(int index): Gets a node from a specific index.
             *  - Size(): Gets the number of nodes from the list.
             *  - IsEmpty(): If the list is empty, it returns true.
             *  - Clear(): Deletes all the nodes from the list.
