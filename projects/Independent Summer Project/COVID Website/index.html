                <h1>Bayes Theorem Calculator</h1>
                <p>Based on various attributes, a Naive Bayes classifier can predict the probability of a dependent variable, such as testing positive for COVID-19. Although this algorithm is being performed on categorical values, it can also work on continuous values as well. Naive Bayes is a wonderful algorithm for solving many classification problems; furthermore, it's relatively easy to understand and implement compared to other classification algorithms. Now, fill out the user input fields and find out your probability of testing positive or negative for COVID-19! </p>
                <p>This example of Naive Bayes uses a dataset that contains exactly 1999 patients. Each patient was asked about these five things and whether they were infected with COVID-19. </p>

                <h1>How Naive Bayes Works</h1>
                <p>To understand the algorithm, it is best to go over an example of performing Naive Bayes on a dataset. By looking at an example, you will have an easier time implementing the algorithm. However, before going over an example, let's look at the Naive Bayes equation. Below is an the equation and the meaning of the terms.</p>
                <div class="equation">
                    <h1>P(A|C) = P(C|A)P(A) / P(C)</h1>

                    <dd>P(A|C): "Posterior Probability" or the probability of 'A' occuring given the evidence 'C' has alrady occured.</dd>
                    <dd>P(C|A): "Likelihood" or the probability of 'C' occuring given the evidence 'A' has already occured.</dd>
                    <dd>P(A): "Prior Probability" or the probabilty of 'A' occuring.</dd>
                    <dd>P(C): "Normalizing Constant" or the probability of 'C' occuring.</dd>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> From performing Naive Bayes on the given attribute values, the probability of playing golf is 24.24% and the probability of not playing golf is 94.21%. Thus, if this was a real life scenario, we would likely conclude that golf would not be played.</p>
